Pairing, the daily stand up, and close communication with the customer and others outside the team go a long way to overcome our instant evaluation of others.

For many, this void has long made enterprise Java development an arduous undertaking. While development life is simple with unit tests and mocks, they only take you so far. Eventually, you need to validate how your components interact and operate in their intended environment&#8212;you need real integration tests. Yet, writing integration tests has meant assuming the burden of bootstrapping all or part of your infrastructure. That&#8217;s time lost and it places a mental barrier on testing.</p>\n<p>Arquillian, a container-oriented testing framework layered atop TestNG and JUnit, tears down this barrier. It does so by bringing your test to the runtime rather than requiring you to manage the runtime from your test. Picking up where unit tests leave off, Arquillian enables you to test real components that rely on real enterprise services in a real runtime. What&#8217;s the secret ingredient?</p>\n<p>This talk will show how Arquillian simplifies integration testing by providing a component model for tests, just as Java EE 5 simplified server-side programming by providing declarative services for application components. The test component model consists of container lifecycle management, test enrichment (dependency injection), container deployment and in-container test execution. Using a component model means your tests are portable and able to move between different environments, from single embedded or remote to multi-server to multi-cloud nodes.</p>\n<p>Attend this talk to learn about the future of Java enterprise testing.</p>",

It first discusses why we chose to use MongoDB as our application&#8217;s primary datastore (what were the relevant application requirements and perceived benefits).  It then covers how we&#8217;re using MongoDB in the application, touching on schema design of the primary collection and listing several secondary uses for it in the architecture.  We also touch on lessons learned, as well as pros and cons.</p>",

People and companies work on open source software and open web applications for a number of reasons from scratching an itch to gaining a reputation to building a resume to contributing to a good cause. The interesting problem comes when money enters into the equation. Research shows that when someone works on something for free for internal rewards, those internal rewards are replaced if you start paying them. Then if you stop paying them, they will stop working on it. So when people get paid to work on open source software, does that change things? If their free web application starts making money, does that change things? How can companies work with these open processes and technologies in a productive way?

        "description": "<p>This session provides an overview of Spring&#8217;s support for scheduling, messaging, and enterprise integration. You will learn how these features provide a platform for message-driven architecture. You will also learn about Spring&#8217;s support for Hohpe and Woolfe&#8217;s Enterprise Integration Patterns. This includes demos of several basic patterns such as Message Channel, Message Transformer, and Message Router, as well as composite patterns such as Scatter/Gather using a Splitter and Aggregator. The examples will also cover different options for adding custom integration logic within the configuration-driven context. Those options include not only POJOs, but also Spring 3.0&#8217;s Expression Language and Groovy scripts. Finally, you will see Channel Adapters and Messaging Gateways that support <span class=\"caps\">JMS</span>, Web Services, Email, and more.</p>",

Of course not everything has worked out as planned and we will also discuss the pitfalls and failed efforts we have experienced along the way, paying attention to the long term consequences of some early architectural decisions.   We will describe the current state of our mac deployment and will wax poetic about some of the interesting projects we&#8217;re planning for the future.</p>",

That&#8217;s why in this talk, we&#8217;ll showcase how the latest developments in the Java EE platform and ecosystem have brought new meaning to the double E: &#8220;Easy&#8221; and &#8220;Extensible&#8221;.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll begin by summarizing the functionality Java EE 6 gives you out of the box. Hint: intelligent defaults replace <span class=\"caps\">XML</span> and disparate technologies have been connected by powerful services like <span class=\"caps\">CDI</span>. We won&#8217;t pretend that one size fits all. You&#8217;ll discover that the closed feature set has been abolished with the inclusion of the <span class=\"caps\">CDI</span> extension facility. You now have the choice of building new features into the programming model in addition to using what&#8217;s provided. That still leaves a lot of work. So we&#8217;ll appeal to your practical side and highlight some of the extensions Seam 3 already has prepared for you.</p>\n<p>Despite all these features, the code isn&#8217;t going to write itself. Or can it? Throughout the talk, you&#8217;ll witness how Forge can incrementally assemble an application at your command. At the end of the talk we&#8217;ll remind you of the fact that you are doing all this with the Enterprise Edition of Java without any of the pain that would seem to imply. Now that was easy.</p>",

His talk steps back to take a look at the mobile environment and what your options are as a designer to help you choose the right path for you and your audience: do we implement a native app or build a web-based interface? Deciding which platform to target doesn&#8217;t hinge only on tech specs or audience reach. Every mobile OS has a different personality, design sensibility, and even government, all of which determine how well your individual app (and its audience) will thrive. Discover the cultural and practical considerations of choosing the right platform(s) for your app and audience, and of crafting a design that works for all.</p>",
